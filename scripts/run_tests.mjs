// Run `node --test` over the patterns given on the command line, then gate what
// it reports against scripts/assertion_floors.json, which commits two floors per
// test file: the cases it runs (measured by scripts/report_cases.mjs) and the
// assertions those cases make (measured by scripts/count_assertions.mjs).
// Neither floor sees what the other does: a file gutted to a comment still
// scores the one pass node reports for a file with no cases, and a case gutted
// to an empty body still scores a pass while asserting nothing.
//
// The floors are per file rather than per run so that one file going quiet is
// not paid for by another growing. Deleting a case drops its file below its
// floor, by design; a file that ran nothing but a skip is exempt, since a suite
// gated on a prerequisite the platform lacks runs nothing without having gone
// away. That exemption is opt-in: the file's floors entry must carry
// `"skippable": true`, so an unconditional skip retiring a file from gating
// shows up as a floors diff instead of a silently green run. A floor is a
// minimum, so cases landing after the last re-measure are covered by none;
// MAX_SURPLUS_CASES bounds how many may sit unratcheted. Re-measure every
// floor in one run:
