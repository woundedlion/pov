// A node:test reporter tallying each file's results, for scripts/run_tests.mjs
// to gate per file. TAP attributes no result to a file — its totals are the
// whole run's — so neither the case counts nor the skips can be read off the
// report the gate already parses.
//
// Reported per file, over `test:pass`/`test:fail`:
//   ran     - tests that reached a result unskipped, which is the file's case
//             count; suites are their tests' parents, not results of their own,
//             so they are not counted.
//   skipped - results carrying a skip, suites included: a skipped suite is the
//             only result its subtree reports, since its cases never enqueue.
// A file that skipped at least once and ran nothing is wholly skipped: gated on
// a prerequisite this platform lacks, and so exempt from its floors. A file
// that reported nothing at all is absent, and is exempt from nothing.
